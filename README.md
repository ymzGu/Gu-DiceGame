# Gu-DiceGame   

Based on \<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"\>ï¼Œthis page has been set up to look good on different screen sizes with different internal page displays.   

To prevent the string received by "Promt" from being too long, the string is shortened to the specified length in Chinese and other cases (mainly English). If the value is an empty string or the user clicks cancel, the default value will be applied.   

The text selection feature of the dice rolling button has been disabled to prevent interference with visibility caused by multiple clicks.
